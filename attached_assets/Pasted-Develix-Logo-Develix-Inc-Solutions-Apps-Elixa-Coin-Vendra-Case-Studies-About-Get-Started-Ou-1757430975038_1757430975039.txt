Our Story
From Adazi to the World
Founded in 2025 by 17-year-old Alexius Dubem and 16-year-old Jerome Ebube in Anambra State — a journey from a spark of dreams to trials, reality, and a passion for technology.

The Beginning
In 2025, two teenagers from Anambra State dared to believe they could shape Africa’s future through technology. Alexius Dubem (17) and Jerome Ebube (16) were not Silicon Valley insiders, but passionate dreamers driven by curiosity and determination.

What started as late-night conversations about coding, digital finance, and innovation quickly grew into a shared vision: build a company that would bridge the gap between African talent and global technology.

From a spark of dreams, through trials and reality, Develix was born — a company built on passion, resilience, and the belief that age and geography are no barriers to innovation.

Technology Without Barriers
We believe advanced technology should be accessible to everyone. Every solution we build removes barriers instead of creating them.

African Roots, Global Vision
From Anambra to the world — we honor our Nigerian heritage while building solutions that compete globally and solve universal problems.

Excellence Through Simplicity

Our Anambra hub buzzes with the spirit of youth, resilience, and creativity. From after-school brainstorming sessions to weekend hackathons fueled by local food and big dreams, we are redefining what it means to build tech in Africa.

We believe the best technology comes from diverse perspectives. Our team reflects Africa’s energy and ambition, solving problems that matter to everyday people in real markets.

Remote-first, youth-driven: While we’re rooted in Anambra, we’ve built systems that allow talented people across Africa (and beyond) to contribute to our vision.
