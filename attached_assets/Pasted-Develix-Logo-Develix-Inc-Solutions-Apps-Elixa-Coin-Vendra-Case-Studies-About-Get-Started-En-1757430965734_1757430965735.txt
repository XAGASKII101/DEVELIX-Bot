FirstBank Nigeria Digital Transformation
How we helped Nigeria's oldest bank modernize their core systems and achieve 300% improvement in transaction processing speed

The Challenge
FirstBank's legacy systems were struggling with increasing transaction volumes, causing delays and customer frustration. Their 30-year-old COBOL-based infrastructure needed modernization without disrupting daily operations serving 10+ million customers.

System downtime: 12 hours/month
Customer complaints: 2,500/month
Our Solution
We implemented a microservices architecture with AI-powered transaction processing, maintaining backward compatibility while introducing modern capabilities. Our phased approach ensured zero downtime during migration.
